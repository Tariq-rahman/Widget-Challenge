# Widget-Challenge
My solution to the Wally's widget challenge, uses PHP version 7.2.27

## How to use
Fastest way to see the code in action is to copy the code and paste it into www.phptester.net and click run.
you can test out different sizes of packets and widgets by playing around with the parameters of the widget object on line 3.

The other way of running this is to download the repo and run the php script from the command line.

## Output 
The output of the script uses `print_r` to print out the array so it will look something like this `Array ( [0] => 5000 [1] => 5000 [2] => 2000 [3] => 500 [4] => 250 )` where each number is packet size required.
